Hello, and welcome.

This is my small corner of the internet — a place for illustrations, projects I'm working on, things I'm reading, and occasional thoughts that feel worth sharing.

I've been meaning to make this space for a while. Somewhere that feels handmade and personal, rather than algorithmic and optimized. A place where the texture matters as much as the content.

## What you'll find here

- **Illustrations**: Sketches, studies, and finished pieces. I'll share what I'm working on, experiments with different media, and the occasional process post.

- **Projects**: Things I've built or helped build. Design work, product thinking, collaborations.

- **Blog**: Essays, reflections, and notes on things I'm learning or thinking about.

- **Books**: My reading list with notes — what I've read, what stood out, and who recommended it.

## Why this format

I wanted something that felt more like a zine than a portfolio. Less polished, more real. The stitched borders and paper textures aren't just aesthetic — they're a reminder that this is something I made by hand, with care.

More soon.
